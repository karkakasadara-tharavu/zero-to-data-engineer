### Interview Preparation

**Common Interview Formats**:

**Round 1: Recruiter Screen** (30 min)
- Behavioral questions (tell me about yourself, why data engineering?)
- Salary expectations
- Availability and timeline

**Round 2: Technical Screen** (60 min)
- SQL coding challenge (live or take-home)
  - Example: "Write a query to find customers with no orders in last 90 days"
- SSIS / ETL conceptual questions
  - Example: "How would you implement incremental loads?"

**Round 3: System Design** (60-90 min)
- Design a data pipeline for a specific use case
- Example: "Design ETL for daily sales data from 500 stores"
- Discuss trade-offs, error handling, scalability

**Round 4: Behavioral + Culture Fit** (45-60 min)
- STAR method questions (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- Teamwork, conflict resolution, handling failure
- Questions for interviewers

**Sample Questions & Answers**:

**Q: Explain the difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes.**

**A (Structured Response)**:
```
A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table. 
There can only be ONE clustered index per table because the data rows 
themselves are sorted in that order. It's like a phonebook sorted alphabetically.

A non-clustered index creates a separate structure with pointers to the actual data. 
You can have multiple non-clustered indexes per table (up to 999 in SQL Server). 
It's like the index at the back of a textbook.

In my capstone project, I created a clustered index on OrderDate in the fact table 
to optimize date range queries, and non-clustered indexes on CustomerID and 
ProductID for foreign key lookups, which improved query performance by 70%.
```

**Q: How would you handle a failed SSIS package in production?**

**A (Real-World Approach)**:
```
1. Immediate Response: Check error logs and SQL Server Agent job history to 
   identify the failure point (which task failed and why).

2. Assess Impact: Determine if downstream reports are affected and notify stakeholders.

3. Troubleshoot: Common causes include source data issues (missing file, bad data), 
   network connectivity, or insufficient disk space. I'd check these systematically.

4. Implement Fix: If it's a transient issue (network timeout), I'd rerun the package. 
   If it's data quality, I'd redirect bad rows to an error table and process good rows.

5. Prevention: In my projects, I implement robust error handling with Try-Catch, 
   email notifications, and logging to an audit table. I also use checkpoints 
   in SSIS so packages can restart from the failure point rather than from the beginning.

Example: In Module 07, I built an incremental load package with error handling 
that automatically retries failed rows 3 times before logging them for manual review.
```
