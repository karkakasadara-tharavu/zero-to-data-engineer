**கற்க கசடற - Learn Flawlessly**

## Overview

Welcome to **Module 11: Advanced Python & Object-Oriented Programming**! This module builds on Python fundamentals and introduces you to the powerful paradigm of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). You'll learn to design and implement classes, work with inheritance, understand polymorphism, and master advanced Python features that are essential for building scalable, maintainable applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand OOP Concepts**: Master the four pillars of OOP - encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
2. **Create Classes and Objects**: Design and implement custom classes with attributes and methods
3. **Work with Inheritance**: Build class hierarchies and understand inheritance patterns
4. **Implement Polymorphism**: Use method overriding and duck typing effectively
5. **Use Special Methods**: Implement magic/dunder methods for operator overloading
6. **Apply Decorators**: Use property decorators, class methods, and static methods
7. **Handle Exceptions**: Create custom exceptions for better error handling
8. **Use Context Managers**: Implement the context manager protocol for resource management
9. **Understand Composition**: Build complex objects through composition patterns
10. **Design Applications**: Apply OOP principles to real-world application design

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 10: Python Fundamentals
- Understanding of functions, data structures, and basic Python syntax
- Familiarity with error handling and file operations
