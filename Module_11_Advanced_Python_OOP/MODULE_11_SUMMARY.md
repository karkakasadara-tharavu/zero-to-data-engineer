### Fundamentals
✅ **Classes and Objects**: Creation, instantiation, methods, attributes  
✅ **Instance vs Class Attributes**: When to use each, naming conventions  
✅ **Method Types**: Instance methods, class methods (`@classmethod`), static methods (`@staticmethod`)  

### Core OOP Principles
📚 **Inheritance**: Building class hierarchies, single and multiple inheritance  
📚 **Polymorphism**: Method overriding, duck typing, flexible interfaces  
📚 **Encapsulation**: Data hiding, property decorators, validation  
📚 **Abstraction**: Abstract base classes, interface design  

### Advanced Features
📚 **Special Methods**: Magic/dunder methods for custom behavior  
📚 **Property Decorators**: Clean getters/setters with `@property`  
📚 **Composition**: Building complex objects, "has-a" vs "is-a"  
📚 **Design Patterns**: Common OOP patterns and best practices  

## Practical Applications

Students will build:
- **Employee Management System** - HR system with departments and payroll
- **Banking Application** - Accounts with transactions and inheritance
- **Shape Calculator** - Geometric shapes with polymorphism
- **Game Characters** - RPG characters with abilities and inventory
- **File Manager** - File system simulator with composition
- **E-commerce System** - Products, orders, shopping carts

## Integration with Data Engineering Track

### Module 10 → Module 11 Connection:
- Builds on Python fundamentals (functions, data structures)
- Adds OOP for better code organization
- Prepares for Pandas classes (DataFrame, Series)

### Module 11 → Module 12 Connection:
- OOP knowledge essential for Pandas
- Understanding classes helps with DataFrame methods
- Properties and methods used extensively in data manipulation

### Module 11 → Modules 13-17 Connection:
- Database ORM patterns (SQLAlchemy uses OOP)
- PySpark DataFrame inherits OOP concepts
- Design patterns for data pipelines

## Implementation Notes
